# Network Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing networks using various techniques and tools. The folder contains code, a scientific report, and a proposal document.

## Folder Structure

```
Network Analysis/
├── Code.ipynb          # Jupyter Notebook for network analysis
├── Scientific Report.pdf # Detailed report on the analysis
├── proposal.pdf        # Proposal outlining the goals and methodology
```

## Code

The `Code.ipynb` notebook contains the implementation of network analysis techniques. It includes:
- Data preprocessing
- Network construction
- Visualization
- Metrics calculation

## Proposal

The `proposal.pdf` outlines the initial goals and approach for the network analysis project.

## Images

Below are some of the key visualizations generated during the analysis (see the `figures/` folder for all images):
