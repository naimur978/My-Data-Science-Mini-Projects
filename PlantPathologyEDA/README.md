Welcome to the Plant Pathology EDA project.

## What is this?
This notebook is focused on exploring and modeling plant disease images. It is a multi class classification problem. I use deep learning (EfficientNet, TensorFlow) to classify leaf images and aim for the best accuracy using techniques like stratified cross-validation and test-time augmentation.

## Technologies Used
- Python (main language)
- TensorFlow & Keras (for deep learning)
- EfficientNet (image classification)
- Pandas, NumPy (data wrangling)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly (visualization)
- Scikit-learn (metrics, splitting)

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or newer
- tensorflow
- efficientnet
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly
- scikit-learn


## Input
- CSV files with image labels (e.g., train.csv, test.csv)
- Image files (JPG/PNG) in a folder

## Output
- Trained model files (JSON, HDF5)
- Submission CSVs for competitions
- Plots and charts for EDA

## How to Use
1. Put your images and CSVs in the right folders.
2. Run the notebook step by step (or all at once).
3. Check out the visualizations and results.
4. Export your predictions for submission.
